# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Geting a handle on this so quickly was impressive, Im liking vue a lot!
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? It was crazy how well Vue works together and how it fixes a lot of tedious actions from using HTML/CSS/JS
- What are you struggling with? Im still trying to find a good study routine and get a good grasp on how it all should work. I'll be getting it down though, just have to invest more time into it.
- What would you count as a victory?: Even though I didnt get 100% of the requirements, Im glad glad I still made majority, so that at the very least I can make it up to a redo.
