## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?: One-To-One, One-To-Be and Many-To-Many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`: Its more efficient to retrieve the document

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?: When you have thousands of a particular item being added and removed, it can be impractical to use n:m. In a case like that, its best to use one way embedding.
