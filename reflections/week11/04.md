## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.: I have really enjoyed everyone's support throughout this, and even though this material has been incredibly difficult, I have found it really interesting. I have a feeling that the final will be tough, but I think I will be able to manage my time correctly as long as I keep on working hard daily and put in good effort. Thank you CodeWorks staff for helping me and being so supportive.
