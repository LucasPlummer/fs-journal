## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table, while with a foreign key, is used to establish a link between data in two tables.

2. What is an `Alias`?: It helps create a new name for the project.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections: 
SELECT *
FROM doctors 
JOIN doctors_patients 
ON doctors.id = doctors_patients.doctorId
JOIN patients
ON doctors_patients.patientId = patients.id

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: I was able to make two modals appear at once on the screen for front end, and was able to get all of the recipes to appear on the screen.
