> **ðŸ“– [Let-Var-Const](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk2/01-Let-Var-Const)**

## Questions

1. What is Scope ?: It shows where variables are available to use 

2. What is Hoisting ?: variables and function declarations are moved to the top of the code, which means its an easier way of showing the order of operations. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?: let can create blocks and can work without names preexisting, const remains the same within the scope, and var can be redeclared.
