# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?: Getting a handle on javascript
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?: time increments was a surprise, I didn't think we would learn something like that so soon.
- What are you struggling with?: Taking too much time at focusing at one particular problem- I need to be more open, and to ask more questions when I struggle. 
- What would you count as a victory?: Getting through so much of the checkpoint just in one day.
