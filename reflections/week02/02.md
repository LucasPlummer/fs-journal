## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?: Function declaration, function expressions and arrow function. Honestly, its just a variety of ways to write the same thing, just depends on you and the style of how you want to write your code.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?: Parameters are used when defining a function, like the name, and arguments are the values of the function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?:  when a function accepts another function as a parameter, or it returns a function, it is called a higher-order function. Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter are some examples.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: javascript is complicated. That is all. Just kidding, although it is complicated, working with logic and having functional buttons to see on the website (even if it just appears on the terminal!) is great to see.
