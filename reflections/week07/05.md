# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?: Being able to pull through and being able to pass this checkpoint 
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?: It was a surprise to find that working on a checkpoint during the week is a bit harder than I thought, but I do prefer it more than doing it over the weekend! It can be motivating and helpful to have the TA's around to help out.
- What are you struggling with?: I'm struggling with trying to manage the pressure and stress of these upcoming weeks. There's going to be a lot that happens, but I know its just a matter of changing my expectations and taking it on one thing at a time.
- What would you count as a victory?: Being able to at least attend the finals! I'm glad that I have made it this far. Checkpoints are done. All thats left now is capstones and finals!
