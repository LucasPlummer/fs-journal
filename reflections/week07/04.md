2. What went well this week?: Getting a better grasp on the backend was something I was really interested in.

3. What would you do differently?: Keep working more, and keep asking more questions. I cant be afraid to ask questions.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: Today I was able to knock out a lot of front end, this was a bit more difficult for me. Styling is a bit harder for me since theres a lot more key terms I don't understand, and I'm still trying to get a better handle on Vue.
