## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?: pending, resolved and rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?: chaining, which makes it so much more organized by adding if/then, returns and catch.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?:
then() methods are used for when the promise is resolved, and the catch is for if the promise fails.
