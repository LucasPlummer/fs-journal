# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?: I felt like I was able to ask more questions, which made me understand the material more.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?: That API's are a lot deeper than I thought they would be, but theyre very interesting.
- What are you struggling with? Getting a better grasp with the MVC pattern
- What would you count as a victory?: getting Checkpoint 4 complete and not getting two points taken away, and not giving up!
