## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?: were currently using things based off our own API's, but on Friday we are planning to put into work Firebase. In fact, the links we use are coming from a account!

2. What went well so far?: Working in a smaller group has been nice, because I personally have been able to learn much more.

3. What would you do differently? Why?: Probably speak my word a bit more about ideas. I've had a tough time speaking my mind, and getting myself motivated knowing there are others that can help.
