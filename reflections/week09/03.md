## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image? Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format, which can be very large amounts of data.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?: because of the size, the downloads are much larger,processing time is expanded when needing to decode, caching creates much more extra load on your server and cannot be accessed from a public url, hurting more of the user experience.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?: Originally, it provided a way of loading faster when it was embedded directly into the HTML or CSS, but no longer, since we no longer have to wait nearly as longe when waiting for requests for images.
