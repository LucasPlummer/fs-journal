# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?: Being able to get through a lot of the project, despite not being perfect by any means we still learned a lot.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?: That working with other coders in a group would be so difficult. But with proper planning and open communication, it can go a long way.
- What are you struggling with? I still feel very nervous about the final, so now its just a matter of figuring it out and getting through it as best I can. I have a feeling it will go well so long as I stay motivated.
- What would you count as a victory?: Getting through the weeks, honestly! We worked very hard on this project, being the youngest and smallest group while getting a late start was not easy, so I'm proud of the work we were able to accomplish.
