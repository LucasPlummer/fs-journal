## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?: Value type, Reference Type and Pointer Type. They're different based on how they store their value in the memory.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?: bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. Theres no lets or const or anything that we knew before! 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?: it stores the address where the value is being stored. Which means, its pointing at another memory location that holds the data.
