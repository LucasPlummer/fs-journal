## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?: rows are the complete entire objects, while columns are the specific properties inside the row. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.: 
CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age int,
    description (VARCHAR 255) NOT NULL
)


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
- DELETE FROM table_name deletes something specifically from the table, while DROP TABLE table_name deletes the table in its entirety.
