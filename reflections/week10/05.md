# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?: Getting a better handle at managing my time and knowing what comes next.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?: I had a better handle on this than I thought, especially with the back end.
- What are you struggling with?: Getting ready to work on the front end, its a bit daunting for sure.
- What would you count as a victory?: Being able to complete the backend in two days! That was a huge victory.
