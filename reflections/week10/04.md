## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?: They are called strongly typed constants. They allow you to assign names to them. They can be used for filtering by enum and allow you to work integral usage.

2. How can you modify an Enum?: you are able to modify its name and value.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could): In allspice, you can filterby by enum category by using the search bar I think? And also filterby names in our Tower.
