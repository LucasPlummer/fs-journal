# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going?: today is going well. I was able to get the backend done over the weekend, so now I can just focus on front end. I was able to almost finish up the home screen.
- Are you managing your stress?: Managing it the best I can. Honestly, biggest thing on my mind is just trying to wrap up this project. I have been taking the advice about actually sleeping too!
- What has you most worried?: Not getting finished on time. I'm just hoping the rest of the week all goes smoothly.
