# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going?: I have been able to get through the homescreen, and I'm actually really close to finishing up! After the homescreen, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be.
- Are you managing your stress?: I am, I've been carefully managing my mental space and when I know I need to take a break. That's been very crucial especially this week.
- What has you most worried?: Just making sure these last few requirements go over well.
