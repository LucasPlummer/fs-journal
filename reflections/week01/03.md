## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?: Choosing the right colors for emphasis of words, rather than just changing the font size to make it bigger.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.: Nike, Aphex Twin, Youtube

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?: Good design means much more organized navigation and general aesthetics. It can describe the theme and how modern it is very quickly, and that they care about their products/website. Good design also means it leads to where the consumer wants quickly and easily.
