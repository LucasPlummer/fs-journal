## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?: Its to provide a skeletal outline of the website, and get the initial designs down.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?: Low-fidelity are very basic representations of the webpage which can easily and quickly change, mid-fidelity which has a bit more detail and have various shadings, headings and content, and finally high-fidelity which has the highest detail and you can focus on much more specific details you want to work out.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?: Depending on the scale of the project, I think it can be highly important to having a plan, especially of the project is large and has many layers and steps to it. The more prepared and organized for coding, the better.
