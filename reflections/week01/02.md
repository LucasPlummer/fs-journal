## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use: it contains a colon at the beginning followed by a pseudo keyword. Some common ones I think would be :hover and  :after or :before.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?: Specificity helps create higher priorities than other names, even if a name comes after in the top to bottom priority. This can help keep track of ones that are more important and can keep track of things you consider important in the order of the website.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?: Since it overrides all other declarations, having multiple can be very messy and run into many contradictions.
