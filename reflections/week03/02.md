## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?: its to store data privately, and that the objects methods have access to it.      

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?: Breaking changes, leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers and self documenting code.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?: private variables or class members can be create using the # prefix. We want to do this so others don't have access to it.
