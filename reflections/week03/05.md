# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?: That I know how tough this course is, and that I know I need to ask for help.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?: The checkpoint was really tough- I didn't think I would have to work on it during the weekend.
- What are you struggling with?: The checkpoint is very difficult for me, I don't know what's not clicking for me, especially since others were able to get it done in just a day.
- What would you count as a victory?: Still staying true and trying to work on it even though it's difficult.
